# evmc-vm-interface Specification

## Purpose
This specification defines the EVMC (Ethereum Client-VM Connector API) interface implementation for DTVM, providing a standardized bridge between Ethereum clients and the DTVM execution engine. The specification ensures ABI compatibility with EVMC version 12 while enabling high-performance EVM bytecode execution through DTVM's runtime capabilities including interpreter and JIT compilation modes.
